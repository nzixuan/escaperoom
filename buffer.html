                You notice a stack of papers on the side, seems like this guy browses instagram
                There's many papers and many different dates. Seems like theres a key to solving this.

                Seems like theres a code here along with a date: POST,WORD ; 
                <!--Digging deeper you notice he was searching instagram on May 15th-->

                Perhaps starting from the first post at time the professor searched will be a good start.
