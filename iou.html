                Now, what you need to do involves information outside. 
                <!--In this scenario, we need you to find out more about Nus SoC and its founding date-->

                Hint: This problem and a few others will involve leaving the website and googling things or 
                visiting the source code for clues.
                <!--Time to put your googling skills to the test-->
