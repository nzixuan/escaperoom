        You uploaded the files into your USB drive and were about to leave the
        room when you hear a voice “<br />
        Professor ____ I didn’t expect you here today.”<br /><br />
        It was the security.<br /><br />
        Craftily you replied “ Oh no Professor isn’t here today. I’m his
        assistant and I came to pick up some files for him” <br />You could
        sense some doubt in the security’s voice as he replied “I didn’t hear
        that professor had any assistant coming. <br />If you truly are his
        assistant then you must know his favourite artist." <br /><br />What
        song does the professor like listening to the most you wonder...
